;;
;; Check the assignment_test.rkt for examples of how to use these functions.
;;

;; Write a function which returns the cube of a given number `x`
(define (cube x)
  0)

;; Write a function which returns 3 times the given number `x`
(define (triple x)
  0)

;; Find the area of a rectangle for a given length and width.
(define (rectangle-area length width)
  0)

;; Write a predicate to check whether the given length and width is of a square shape.
;; Also write a few tests to check if your solution is working for a range of inputs.
(define (square? length width)

;; Write a function compare which is defined as follows
;; compare(x, y) = 1 when x > y
;; compare(x, y) = 0 when x = y
;; compare(x, y) = -1 when x < y
(define (compare x y)
